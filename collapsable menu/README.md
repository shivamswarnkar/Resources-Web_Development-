# Resources-Web_Development --> Collapsable menu
## How To Use
>Simply copy all the files, add html code from the <nav> tag into your html file where you want a collapsable menu. (don't forget the style). To add more menu item, just add more 
```html
> <span id="menu-x"> </span>
<!--Where x will be the number of the item, and you'll be good to go. Use active class for the currently open menu item.-->
```


***Note: Currently it has a basic design, we will add new features like ability to control animation of menu, hover properties and more types of menu.***
